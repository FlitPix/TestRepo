# Java Test Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio to document my progress in learning Java. It is intended for reference use, and was built over the course of a class I took during my Spring 2023 semester of college.

## Portfolio

These are the packages I've created in this repository that I feel are most exemplary. Many more can be found in this repository's code.
